    <h3>Projects</h3>
<b>1. Real-Time Crypto Portfolio Tracker</b>

Technologies: React, Redux Toolkit (State Management), Tailwind CSS, WebSockets, Chart.js

Developed a single-page application (SPA) to monitor and visualize over 100 cryptocurrency prices and portfolio performance in real-time.

Implemented global state management using Redux Toolkit to handle complex asynchronous data fetching and prevent prop drilling.

Utilized WebSockets to establish persistent connections for instant price updates, achieving less than 50ms latency between market feed and UI rendering.

Designed and built a highly responsive dashboard using Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal display and performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

<b>2. Interactive SVG Data Visualization Tool</b>

Technologies: Vue.js 3 (Composition API), D3.js, SCSS/CSS Grid, Jest

Engineered a dynamic visualization library capable of rendering large datasets (up to 10,000 data points) using performant SVG rendering with D3.js.

Created custom Vue composables for shared logic (e.g., debouncing user input, fetching data), resulting in a 30% reduction in component complexity.

Implemented accessibility (WCAG) standards, including keyboard navigation and ARIA labels, making the visualization tool usable by screen readers.

Wrote comprehensive unit tests using Jest to ensure the reliability of state mutations and data rendering logic.

<b>3. Customizable Drag-and-Drop Form Builder
</b>
Technologies: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API, Custom CSS Variables

Built a lightweight framework-agnostic form builder interface, allowing users to drag elements (e.g., text inputs, checkboxes) onto a canvas and reorder them.

Optimized interaction performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and utilizing the native Drag and Drop API, achieving smooth interaction at 60 FPS.

Designed the UI with modular, maintainable BEM-structured CSS and leveraged CSS variables for efficient theming and customization.

Implemented a local storage feature to persist the form layout configuration across user sessions.
